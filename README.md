# color-battle

An Android application of the game "Color Battle"

The game is simple. You and your mate must color the Nodes of a Graph. The major rule is that you can't color a Node if this is connected to another Node with the same color. Initialy we are planning to make the game with the option to play with 3 or 4 colors.
